/*
The unsaid tone of weak despair fail to resonate
Frayed end of our binding threads will disintegrate
Now by the laws our physique state
Failure to communicate, none to sentient

Hear no, see no works it's magic against all function
Ongoing choices the trials will end
Filter the nonsense and laugh at what's left
Indecision, non-vision what matters taken away

Look at the shell that is you empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over, lost to apathy

So overcome with pointless
Tears to test pain receptors
Nothing matters ever here put up a non reaction
These eyes will never see, covered up from reality

Look at the shell that is you empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over, lost to apathy

The unknown world that you deny, no priority
Cannot fail if you never start, how predictable
I want to know where did it end for madness to start
Always the skeptic, never be part
Introvertive, indescriptive it matters not, not

Look at the shell that is you empty, fragile, weak
Look at the shell that is you empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over, lost to apathy

The shell that is you empty, fragile, weak
Now the battle is over, lost to apathy
