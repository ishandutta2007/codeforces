/*
We always were too close - one day I will overdose.
The cross I can't wait to bear, the sweetest drug I love to fear.

Creep up on me from behind, without a sound, sweet darkness of mine.

Autumnal grace you are, mother of my every scar.
You walk this road alongside me, in every shadow that I see.
You damage me, damage me. Com damage me.

Creep up on me from behind, without a sound, sweet darkness of mine.

Oh, sweetest little lover, twisted girl of dark.
You seduce me with your beauty.
So lay me down and lick my skin with your sweetest sickly tongue.

Deadly sister, I give myself to you.
So lick me, every inch of my soul, and send me naked into the void.
Pave the road and sink your thirstiest teeth into my neck.

(Creep up on me from behind, without a sound)
Darkness of mine.
(Creep up on me from behind, without a sound)
Tell me every lie and I'll save you.
I'm in.
(Creep up on me from behind, without a sound)
Simply won't give in.
Oh lover, you damage me, you damage me, again and again.
Come damage me.
'Cause without that pain, I am nothing.
