/*  
Walking the final mile...
In, into the black,
I won't back,
Choose to be here a while...

Then I saw your face,
And I heard the words you said.
Then I recalled your name,
And why I'm here...

When I look into your eyes an' saw how much you cried,
An' I had a revelation.
The pain wouldn't pass, the scars they would last,
Into God's creation.
Blessed secrets holding me...
Then we all closed our eyes, an' laid down and sighed:

Live young die free!

A distant chime of mercy ringing one last time.
Into the masses turns to clay...
Molded into what is now, the greater good
To close the story yesterday...

Don't need to see your face,
Don't need to hear a word you say.
Don't need to know your name,
Or why you're here...

Then a child of a liar put his hands into the fire,
Called it discontention.
And a man with the word repeated what he heard,
Led to mass confusion.
Blessed secrets, agony...
Then the child closed his eyes and laid down and died.

Live young die free.
