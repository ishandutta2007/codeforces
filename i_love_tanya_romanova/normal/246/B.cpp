/*
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man, 
Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can. 
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam. 

[Chorus:]
Good Times, Bad Times, you know I had my share; 
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man, 
Well, I still don't seem to care. 

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be, 
Only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me. 
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end, 
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh. 

[Chorus]

I know what it means to be alone, I sure do wish I was at home. 
I don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you each and every day. 
You can feel the beat within my heart. 
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part.
