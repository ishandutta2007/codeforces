/*
Time is running so fast
This moment that you live
Instantly everything is past
You wonder where the time has gone

When you were young
You thought I can do that tomorrow
But in moments the years have gone
Feel that you are too old, now it's too late

Live and make true all of your dreams
When you are young
Memories are gold when you are old

Just memories of time
Live forever over our lives
They will see the future
To the end of the time

This little moment that we live here
Don't let us waste it in vain
Let's sail at full speed straight on

Every single dream
Is made to come true for all of us
When we believe in future
And what it will bring to us

Look behind
The curtain of world
You'll see how beautiful all could be
You take challenge of this wonderful life

Live and make true all of your dreams
When you are young
Memories are gold when you are old

Just memories of time
Live forever over our lives
They will see the future
To the end of the time

This little moment that we live here
Don't let us waste it in vain
Let's sail at full speed straight on

Just memories of time
Live forever over our lives
They will see the future
To the end of the time

This little moment that we live here
Don't let us waste it in vain
Let's sail at full speed straight on

Just memories of time
Live forever over our lives
They will see the future
To the end of the time

This little moment that we live here
Don't let us waste it in vain
Let's sail at full speed straight on
