/*
Can you tell from the look in our eyes
Were going nowhere
We live our lives like were ready to die
were going nowhere

Can you tell from the look in our eyes
Were going nowhere
We live our lives like were ready to die
Were going nowhere

I thought I buried you and covered the tracks
Youll have to take this with your cold dead hands
I thought I buried you where sin can never die

I thought I cut you loose, severed the feeling
I stepped through the cracks as you clamp to my shirt
I thought I buried you where sin can never die

Fuck!

Can you tell from the look in our eyes
Were going nowhere
We live our lives like were ready to die
Were going nowhere

You can run but youll never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
Were going nowhere

This is sempiternal
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over again and again

Rise from the dead you said
Secrets don't sleep 'til they're took to the grave 
Signal the sirens, rally the troops
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's the moment of truth.

Can you tell from the look in our eyes
Were going nowhere
We live our lives like were ready to die
Were going nowhere

You can run but youll never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
Were going nowhere

Can you tell from the look in our eyes
Were going nowhere
We live our lives like were ready to die
Were going nowhere

You can run but youll never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
Were going nowhere

This is sempiternal
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over again and again
