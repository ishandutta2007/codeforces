/*
Need
More and more
Tainted misery

Bleed
Battle scars
Chemical affinity

Reign
Legacy
Innocence corrode

Stain
Rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke
Asphyxia
Snuff reality

Scorch
Kill the light
Incinerate celebrity

Reaper
Butchery
Karma amputee

Bloodline
Breeding fine
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You reach the end of the line

Time
Choke the clock
Steal another day

Die
Faithfully
Narcissistic fade away

Twisted
Jump the rail
Shout at the crowd below

Breaker
Chase the ghost
The latest high to all time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You reach the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spinning sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell

The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master

Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind

Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line

The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line
