/*
Her clothes were soaked with mildew
Ropes burned their way
Through her fragile thin wrists
I stood over her watching to see

If she was going to live or die
I remember her screaming
And scratching to my arms while
I was tying her wrists behind her back

She was kicking her legs
Up and down in my direction
Trying to prevent me from knotting the ropes
"Stop crying", I screamed in her face

"You took me for granted this time
How could you've done this to me?"
I said as I punched the ground beside her
Until fists were sore and bloody

"Honey, this could've all been different
If you had wanted it to be"
I gently whispered in her ear
You don't care what you want anymore

This is what I want now
Don't offer me anything
You will be wasting you breath
