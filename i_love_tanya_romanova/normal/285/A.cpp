/* 
I'll gather up the children
And sink my teeth into their flesh
I'll creep into the temples
And put the people to the test
I'll blind your eyes
And tell you lies
I'll make you feel my wrath
I'll put a curse upon the fools
Who dare to cross my path

So now, your time has come
You are to face the wicked one

I'll set the world on fire
And watch the venom start to spread
My children will take over
They'll fill your fucking hearts with dread
Accept your fate, there's no escape
I left no stone unturned
I'll find you out, and when I do
I'll gladly watch you burn

Don't ask me for forgiveness
I'm not one to hear your pleas
I don't hear your cries for mercy
I've no cure for your prayer
Before I rip your face apart
Then turn your back to face the betrayer
To tear your spine and pierce your heart

So now, your time has come
Behold, I am the wicked one.
