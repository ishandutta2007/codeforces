/*
Tell the swine, we will make it out alive
There's a note in the pages of the book
So sleep tonight, we'll sleep dreamlessly this time
When we awake we'll know that everything's alright

Sing to me about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you

Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for
There's some strength left in us yet
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for
There's some hope left in it yet

The snow on your face and your razor blades
The twilight is bruised and there you lie

Sing to me about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you
We'll cry tonight but in the morning we are new
Stand in the sun, we'll dry your eyes

Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for
There's some strength left in us yet
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for
There's some hope left in it yet

Sing, sing, arise

Arise and be
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed
Arise and be
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed

Arise and be
All the you dreamed, all that you dreamed
Arise and be
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed

Arise and be
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed
Arise and be
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed
