/*
There's nothing to me now. An empty shell unfolded.
How, when we learn to pray inside our demons are laughing
How long will this go on? Are we a bit much stronger?
Do you think you can save me from living this way?

I don't know how to love. I just know how to live.
All I feel is hate. Will you forgive me?

For all those things I've done, they keep on creeping by me.
And though we've changed our ways,
still all our demons are laughing.
How long will this go on? Aren't we a bit much stronger?
I'd like to think you've came into my life to stay.

I don't know how to love. I just know how to live.
All I feel is hate. Will you forgive me?
I don't know how to breathe with you too far away.
Don't know how to love. Will you forgive me?
No I can't live this way!
I don't know how to love. I just know how to live.
All I feel is pain. Will you forgive me?
I don't know how to breathe with you too far away.
I don't know how to love.

Past lives I've lived. Uncontrolled but sacred.
You've finally seen all that's left of me.
So hard to feel. So hard to breathe.
Will you forgive me?
