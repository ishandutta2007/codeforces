/*
It's hard to believe it came to this 
You paralysed my body with a poison kiss 
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed 
You thought that was the end of this story 
Something inside me called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you 

You told me, my darling 
Without me, you're nothing 
You taught me to look in your eyes 
And fed me your sweet lies 

Suddenly someone was there in the window 
Looking outside at the sky that had never been blue 
Ah, there's a world without you 
I see the light 
Living in a world without you 
Ah, there is hope to guide me 
I will survive 
Living in a world without you 

It's hard that it came to this 
You paralysed my body with a poison kiss 
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed 
You thought that was the end of this story 
Something inside me called freedom came alive 
Living in a world without you 

You put me together 
Then trashed me for pleasure 
You used me again and again 
Abused me, confused me 

Suddenly naked I run through your garden 
Right through the gates of the past and I'm finally free 
Ah, there's a world without you 
I see the light 
Living in a world without you 
Ah, there is hope to guide me 
I will survive 
Living in a world without you 

It's hard that it came to this

Living in a world without you 
Living in a world without you 
Living in a world without you
