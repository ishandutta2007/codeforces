/*
Kill me... Down by the shore
I can feel it... She is not here anymore
Hear my call... It`s born by the breeze
Tell me... To where do I go?

I would beg, I would plead
But you were still going to leave
The message that I couldn`t see
Lying on the floor
The writings on the wall

Meet me... In the forest, come alone
See the lights... It`s my car coming down the road
I want you... Queen of bizarre
Days of love, like an arrow shot right through the heart

I would beg, I would plead
But you were still going to leave
The message that I couldn`t see
Lying on the floor
The writings on the wall

A shadow cast falls from me over you
Lying on the floor
With the hammer raised to let you know
When the passion dissolves
The blood on the walls

Kill me... Down by the shore
I can feel it... She is not here anymore
Hear my call... It`s born by the breeze
Tell me... To where do I go?

I would beg, I would plead
But you were still going to leave
The message that I couldn`t see
Lying on the floor
The writings on the wall

A shadow cast falls from me over you
Lying on the floor
With the hammer raised to let you know
When the passion dissolves
The blood on the walls

I would beg, I would plead
But you were still going to leave
The message that I couldn`t see
When the passion dissolves
The blood on the walls
