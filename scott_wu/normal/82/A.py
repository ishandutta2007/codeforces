#scott idk how to python
 
n = int(input()) # steven i think this line is valid let's look at some sample code first
mult = 1 #scott more than 5*mult? or how are you doing this
pos = 0 #steven no semicolons;;;;;;;;;;
while n > 5 * mult: #scott python is hard
    break # do it my way :( it's fast enough just n -= mult until pos == 5
while n > mult: #scott oh i got you 
    n -= mult #yoloswag
    pos += 1 #is ++ defined
    if pos == 5: #i think so
        pos = 0 #scott mult wait is *= defined
        mult *= 2 #i hope ++ is defined both ways i'm bad btw and yeah it should be all arithmetic should be same
names = ["Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard"] #scott
print(names[pos]) #yolo
