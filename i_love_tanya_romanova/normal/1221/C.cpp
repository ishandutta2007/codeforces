/*
Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me a live
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

You can say I'm just a gringo
You can say I'm just a man
I live outside the law
Doing anything I can.

I keep the laws I make
And I break the laws you keep.
I'm living on the edge.
Living on the street

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

Each day I fight to live
I fight to stay alive.
Don't get in my way
Unless you want to die.

One who stands tall
Never stands alone.

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

You can say I'm just a gringo
You can say I'm just a man
I live outside the law
Doing anything I can.

I keep the laws I make
And I break the laws you keep.
I'm living on the edge.
Living on the street.

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.
