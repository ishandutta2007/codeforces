/*
Born to push you around
You better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouths so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying, just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hiding yourself, crawling yourself
You'll have your time

God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put it into this I swear
This I swear the sun will shine
This I swear, this I swear
This I swear!
