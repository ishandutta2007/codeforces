/*
Voices inside my head are making me go mad
Now I'm afraid to sleep from nightmares that I've had
I feel I'm on the edge, I need some kind of cure
Now I've gone and killed someone, I'm mentally disturbed!

[Chorus:]
They can't keep me locked away
My psychiatrist says I'm ok
They think that they've got me trained
But I know I'm really deranged!

Arrested for murder, my casecomes to trial
Prosecution's accusing me of things sick and vile
I admit I'm guilty, but plead insanity
Six months at Bellevue, then I'm walking free

[Chorus]

They want to calm me so they feed me thorazine
It doesn't make me calmer, it only makes me mean
Now they let me loose, back in society
With some psychiatric help and a lobotomy
But I've got them fooled, I'm playing at their game
I'm more psycho than before, I don't even know my name
I know they should have killed me when they had the chance
But the system let me off with a little song and dance!
