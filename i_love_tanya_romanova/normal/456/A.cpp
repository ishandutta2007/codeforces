/*
Lay it to rest
You know my word ain't the best
It's just another question of faith
That I must take
Till it's laid to waste
Laid to waste, oh

I stood and I watched you weep
Until I'm gone you're sure to cry some more
I stayed, lit a cigarette
I thought we'd been here some time before

Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Turn your head away
Swear to you now I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away

She said that it's five a.m.
I think it's time for you to go
Got to hurry, got to get on board
And drink myself to sleep at home

Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Turn your head away
Swear to you I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away

Shimmy on down, baby
Shimmy on down, baby
Shimmy on down, baby
Shimmy on down, baby

Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Turn your head away
Swear to you I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away

Booked and I got to hurry
Troubled times and worry
Turn your head away
Swear to you I'm learning
Troubled times are turning
Turn your head away

Shimmy on down baby
Shimmy on down baby
Shimmy on down

Lay it to rest
You know my love ain't the best
This is just another question of taste
That I must take
Till it's laid to waste
