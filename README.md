# codeforces

- Scraped using https://github.com/ishandutta2007/CPScraper
- Do not delete `downloaded` and `errors` files as they act as scrape control.

The steps to do a sparse clone are as follows:
```
mkdir codeforces
cd codeforces
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/ishandutta2007/codeforces
```

This creates an empty repository with your remote, and fetches all objects but doesn't check them out. Then do:
```
git config core.sparseCheckout true
```

Now you need to define which files/folders you want to actually check out. This is done by listing them in `.git/info/sparse-checkout`, eg:

```
echo "tourist" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo "some/dir/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo "another/sub/tree" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
```

only pulls root folder:
```
git pull --depth=1 origin master
```
