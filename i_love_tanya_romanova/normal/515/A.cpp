/*
Father did you miss me?
I've been locked up a while
I got caught for what I did,
but took it all in style
Laid to rest all my confessions,
I gave way back when
Now I'm versed in so much worse
So I am back again

And he said...

For the lines that I take
I'm going to hell
For the love that I make
I'm going to hell
(gettin heavy with the devil you can hear the wedding bells)

Father did you miss me?
Don't ask me where I've been...
You know I know, yes I've been told,
I redefine a sin
I don't know what's driving me,
to put this in my head
Maybe I wish I could die
Maybe I am dead

And he said...

For the lives that I fake
I'm going to hell
For the vows that I break
I'm going to hell
For the ways that I hurt
While I'm hiking up my skirt
I am sitting on a throne
While they're buried in the dirt
For the man that I hate
I'm going to hell
(gettin heavy with the devil you can hear the wedding bells)

Please forgive me father
I didn't mean to bother you
The devil's in me father
He's inside of everything I do

For the life that I take
I'm going to hell
For the laws that I break
I'm going to hell
For the love that I hate
I'm going to hell
For the lies that I make
I'm going to hell
For the way I condescend
Never lend a hand
My arrogance is making this head
Buried in the sand
For the souls I forsake
I'm going to hell
(gettin married to the devil you can hear the wedding bells)
